## Seting-up the server
* For one to start up the application server locally, they need to have node.js installed on your computer.
* In your terminal/ command line, navigate to the directory that includes server.js and enter "node server.js".
* The server starts up on port 3000 in default, you can visit the web application on "http://localhost:3000".
